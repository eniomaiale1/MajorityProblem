# MajorityProblem

The following code implement 3 algorithms to solve the majority problem: 

1.- It is the simplest solution where two loops read the array counting what number has the majority

2.- It is a simple soltuion as well where first we sort the array and then we loop it to count what number is repeated most of the times.

3.-It is the Boyer-Moore voting algorithm where if one number is repeated more that 50% of the times, this algorithm guarratee that can find the most repeated number 

The following image show the time it took each algorithm to find the majority an array of 100k elements
